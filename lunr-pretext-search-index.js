(You must be in person in the classroom to take the exam.)    The exam will cover Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7(Part 1) from the textbook, which are Chapters 2-7 in the course notes. Link to course notes      During the exam you may use your notes, the online course notes, the quiz\/exam information site, a basic calculator (no phone) and a blank Excel file. Some problems will require you to upload an Excel file with all your work\/calculations in order to receive credit. During quizzes you may NOT search the internet, use generative AI or use other resources that are not allowed.    You are NOT allowed to use other people's work or search internet sites while taking the test. If you share you answers and others use them, both you and the students you shared with may receive a zero for the exam and may fail the course.    Even though you are allowed to use your notes and course resources during the exam, I strongly recommend making a cheat sheet to use while you take the exam! It can help you prepare for the exam and be ready for the types of questions that will be on the exam. (If you don't prepare and practice the example problems, you might find yourself spending a long time searching and trying to figure out how to do problems while you're taking the exam.)    Unless otherwise indicated, you must show steps\/include all of your Excel calculations and formulas that demonstrate the process you take to get to the final answer.  For problems involving probability distributions (such as the binomial or normal distribution), you need to use the Excel files to find any relevant values and not use values from a table.  For problems that require showing work, credit will be given for not only the final answer, but the work\/justification\/formulas that supports that answer.    If you have a question during the exam, ask me! It is much better to ask right away than to stay stuck for a long time.      Exam 1 Format   The exam may have some or all of the following problems\/types of problems. (The exam may have all of these types of problems or a subset of these types of problems. Some of these problems might not have all the parts that were on corresponding quiz\/homework problems.) Examples of these problems (except for the multiple choice problems) are shown below under .   Note: On the exam, the problems may not all be labeled with the corresponding quiz objective\/homework problem.   For the multiple choice problems, I recommend looking back at conceptual homework assignments, reviewing concepts from the notes\/the book and making sure you understand the definitions and topics we've talked about.     Multiple choice problems from these chapters     Quiz objective    Link to example solutions for 3a      Quiz outcomes and   Link to Quiz 4 example solutions       Quiz objectives and    Link to example solutions for 1b and 1c      Quiz objective (This problem will require uploading an Excel file with all your work\/formulas.)   Link to example solutions for 2a      Quiz objective (This problem will require uploading an Excel file with all your work\/formulas.)   Link to example solutions for 3b      Box-and-whisker plot: You will be given a dataset and asked to construct a box-and-whisker plot for the data. You will need to list the values of the first three quartiles: Q1, Q2, and Q3 and identify any outliers in the data. You will need to do all of your work in Excel and upload the file to Canvas. This is similar to parts of quiz objective .     Problem using the Empirical Rule      Problem identifying mistake in a solution using Chebyshev's Theorem.   (We did a problem using Chebyshev's Theorem in Exercise 3.3.11(d) in the Course Notes, and it might help to look back at that .)     Quiz outcome   Link to Quiz 4 example solutions        Suggestions for Study  Look over all of your class notes and make sure you understand everything we have talked about. Look back at these chapters\/problems in the textbook. Review the MyLab homework and the quiz problems. (I do not guarantee that all exam questions will look exactly like one of those problems.)  Be able to do the problems under , and potentially include those on your cheat sheet .      Quiz outcome :   We want to create a histogram using the Data Analysis add-in in Excel. If we use the Rule to find the number of bins, which of the following would be a histogram for weight (in lbs) in the Excel file below?                                                 Quiz outcome :   The Excel file below includes data about cars released in 1993. Use the Excel file to create a bar chart for drive_train .     The different options for drive train are below:   front    rear    4WD     (On the exam you will do all of your work in the attached file and then save and upload it on Canvas.)   (One way to do this is to first create a frequency distribution using the \"COUNTIF\" function and use that to create your bar chart.)          Quiz objective :   Consider the data included in the Excel file below:       Find the mean of this data set. (Round your answer to two decimal places.)        Find the median of this data set.        Find the mode of this data set. (Enter \"none\" of there is no mode and if there are multiple modes, then enter them in increasing order separated by commas and no spaces.)   none    Identify whether or not there may be left or right skew in this data set. (Enter \"left\", \"right\", or \"none\".)   Either right or none would be correct answers here. (Technically the mean is to the right of the median, but they are very close together.)      Quiz objective :   (This problem will be multiple choice for each part -- you’ll need to choose which of several fractions is the correct probability.)  The airline industry defines an on-time flight as one that arrives within 15 minutes of its scheduled time. The following table shows the number of on-time and late flights leaving Philadelphia and arriving in Orlando during a recent time period by airline:     Airline  On-Time Flights  Late Flights    Southwest  240  70    American  260  140    Frontier  170  65      What is the probability that a randomly selected flight was from American and was on time?

Given that the flight was late, what is the probability that it was from Frontier?       Given that the flight was from Frontier, what is the probability that it was late?          Quiz objective :   (For this problem, round each answer to 4 decimal places. Do not round until you have the final answer.)  Consider store that sells primarily PCs. Each customer that comes in may buy one, none or several PCs. Let denote the number of PCs a customer who comes into the store purchases. Consider the following probability distribution table for :             ???           What is the value of the missing entry?    Find the expected value of , .    Find the variance of , .    Find the standard deviation of , .           Box-and-whisker plot  The data in the attached file below shows the amount spent on lunch by a random sample of customers at a local restaurant.     Construct a box-and-whisker plot for the data. List the values of the first three quartiles: Q1, Q2, and Q3. Are there any outliers in the data? If so, identify them.  (On the exam you will do all of your work in the attached file and then upload your file on Canvas.)  (Note: your quartile values should be the same as the values of the quartiles shown in your box-and-whisker plot.)         Problem using the Empirical Rule   The average employees' annual healthcare costs at a particular company for 2024 was with a standard deviation of . If the distribution of those healthcare costs is approximately bell-shaped, between what two values would 95% of employees' share of annual healthcare costs fall? (Hint: Use the Empirical Rule.)  Include all of your calculations in the Excel file that you upload.        Problem identifying mistake in a solution using Chebyshev’s Theorem:   Assume the average selling price for houses in a certain county is with a standard deviation of . Assume that the distribution of home selling prices is not bell-shaped.  We want to find a range of prices that we expect to include at least of the homes around the mean. A student wanted to solve this problem and did the work below. Identify the issue or mistake with this work\/solution.  Student's solution:          So the range of prices including values within of the mean will include at least of the homes.        This solution is correct and does not have a mistake. On the exam, you might have a version that is not correct and you will need to determine what the mistake is. (This problem will be multiple choice.)

  "body": " Exam 2 Information   Exam 2 Information  Exam 2 will be available on Canvas to take during class on the day listed in the syllabus. (You must be in person in the classroom to take the exam.)     The exam will cover Chapters 7(Part 2), 8, 9, and 13 from the textbook, which are Chapters 8-11 in the course notes: Link to course notes      During the exam you may use your notes, the online course notes, the quiz\/exam information site, a basic calculator (no phone) and a blank Excel file. Some problems will require you to upload an Excel file with all your work\/calculations in order to receive credit. During quizzes you may NOT search the internet, use generative AI or use other resources that are not allowed.    You are NOT allowed to use other people's work or search internet sites while taking the test. If you share you answers and others use them, both you and the students you shared with may receive a zero for the exam and may fail the course.    Even though you are allowed to use your notes and course resources during the exam, I strongly recommend making a cheat sheet to use while you take the exam! It can help you prepare for the exam and be ready for the types of questions that will be on the exam. (If you don't prepare and practice the example problems, you might find yourself spending a long time searching and trying to figure out how to do problems while you're taking the exam.)    Unless otherwise indicated, you must show steps\/include all of your Excel calculations and formulas that demonstrate the process you take to get to the final answer.  For problems involving probability distributions (such as the binomial or normal distribution), you need to use the Excel files to find any relevant values and not use values from a table.  For problems that require showing work, credit will be given for not only the final answer, but the work\/justification\/formulas that supports that answer.    If you have a question during the exam, ask me! It is much better to ask right away than to stay stuck for a long time.       Exam 2 Format   The exam may have some or all of the following problems\/types of problems. (The exam may have all of these types of problems or a subset of these types of problems. Some of these problems might not have all the parts that were on corresponding quiz\/homework problems.) Examples of these problems (except for the multiple choice problems) are shown below under .   Note: On the exam, the problems may not all be labeled with the corresponding quiz objective\/homework problem.   For the multiple choice problems, I recommend looking back at conceptual homework assignments, reviewing concepts from the notes\/the book and making sure you understand the definitions and topics we've talked about.

Look back at these chapters\/problems in the textbook. Review the MyLab homework and the quiz problems. (I do not guarantee that all exam questions will look exactly like one of those problems.)    Note that the exam questions will not look exactly like the problems below. For example, the example problem might be a right-tailed test, and on the exam you could have a problem that is a left-tailed or a two-tailed test. Make sure you understand each step of the example problems so that you would be able to do a slightly different version of a similar problem.    Quiz outcome :   A company wondered if people liked the user interface of their upgraded website. They survey a random selection of their customers.  Suppose that for surveyed customers, 32 preferred the new user interface.   Find a confidence interval for the proportion of all the company's customers that prefer the new interface.    ,         Convidence interval formula:   The confidence interval is approximately:    Suppose the company claims that at least of all the company's customers prefer the new interface. Does the confidence interval you found support this claim? Explain why or why not.   No, it does not. We are confident that is between and , and is larger than .     Exercises 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 from the Course Notes: ( )   For a normal population with a mean equal to 87 and a standard deviation equal to 16, determine the probability of observing a sample mean of 90 or less from a sample of size 15.       For a population that is left-skewed with a mean of 21 and a standard deviation equal to 15, determine the probability of observing a sample mean of 18 or more from a sample of size 33.         Quiz outcome :   A CEO is curious if the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than . They conduct a survey of employees. Suppose that for surveyed employees, 125 were satisfied with their job. Use and test the hypothesis that the proportion of all employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than .   State the null hypothesis.       State the alternative hypothesis.     (right-tail test)   Find the appropriate test statistic.       What is the p-value?       What do we conclude and why? Do we have enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than ? Why or why not?   Since the p-value is bigger than , we fail to reject the null hypothesis. So there is not enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than .     Quiz outcome :   A farmer is curious about the effects of a new fertilizer on the height of her corn stalks. She measures the heights of a random selection of her stalks. Out of 55 measured corn stalks, the sample average height is meters, with sample standard deviation meters. Use and test the hypothesis that the average height of her corn stalks is not equal to meters.   State the null hypothesis.       State the alternative hypothesis.       Find the appropriate test statistic.       What is the p-value?   (This is a two-tail test.)     (or: )   What do we conclude and why? Do we have enough evidence to conclude that the average height of her corn stalks is not equal to 2.3 meters?   Since the p-value is less than , we reject the null hypothesis. So we do have enough evidence to conclude that the average height is not equal to 2.3 meters.     Week 10 HW Question 6:   Consider the hypothesis statment given below:    Assume that , , and .   Calculate the appropriate test statistic.       Determine the appropriate critical value(s).   (This is a right-tailed test.)      Should you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis?   Since the test statistic is in the rejection region, we should reject the null hypothesis. (It might help to draw a picture to see this.)   Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that the population variance is greater than 7.0?   Yes! Since we rejected the null hypothesis, there is enough evidence to conclude that .     Week 10 HW Question 8:   Suppose a student has two possible routes for their commute to school. Because they never want to be late for class, they want to choose the route that provides a more consistent commute time. Being a hopeless statistician, the student meticulously drove the first route 20 times and the second route 25 times and calculated the standard deviations for each. The following table summarizes sample data collected from two different routes.      Route A  Route B    sample standard deviation  6.5 minutes  10.4 minutes    sample size  25  20      Using , we want to determine if Route A provides a more consistent commute time than Route B. First, state the null alternative hypotheses. (Let represent the larger sample variance and represent the smaller sample variance.)   (Since Route B has the bigger sample standard deviation, Route B is Population 1 and Route A is Population 2 .)         Calculate the appropriate test statistic.       Calculate the appropriate critical value (using ).       What can we conclude? Do we have enough evidence to conclude that Route A provides a more consistent commute time than Route B? Why or why not?   Since the test statistic is in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis and have enough evidence to conclude that Route A provides a more consistent commute time than Route B.    "

  "body": "  Week 10 HW Question 8:   Suppose a student has two possible routes for their commute to school. Because they never want to be late for class, they want to choose the route that provides a more consistent commute time. Being a hopeless statistician, the student meticulously drove the first route 20 times and the second route 25 times and calculated the standard deviations for each. The following table summarizes sample data collected from two different routes.      Route A  Route B    sample standard deviation  6.5 minutes  10.4 minutes    sample size  25  20      Using , we want to determine if Route A provides a more consistent commute time than Route B. First, state the null alternative hypotheses. (Let represent the larger sample variance and represent the smaller sample variance.)   (Since Route B has the bigger sample standard deviation, Route B is Population 1 and Route A is Population 2 .)         Calculate the appropriate test statistic.       Calculate the appropriate critical value (using ).       What can we conclude? Do we have enough evidence to conclude that Route A provides a more consistent commute time than Route B? Why or why not?   Since the test statistic is in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis and have enough evidence to conclude that Route A provides a more consistent commute time than Route B.  "

If you are given a version with unequal variances, then I will give you degrees of freedom in the problem.   Assume for parts (a)-(d).  A researcher wants to study average commute time for students at UCCS and students at CU Denver. Out of 35 students from CU Denver, the average commute time was , with sample standard deviation minutes. Then out of 30 students from UCCS, the average commute time was minutes, with sample standard deviation minutes.  Assume that the population variances are not equal and that .  We want to test the hypothesis that the difference in the average commute times between CU Denver students and UCCS students is less than 15 minutes.   State the null hypothesis.
