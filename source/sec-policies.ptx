    <title>UCCS Student Code of Conduct and Professionalism</title>

    <p>
        The purpose of the <url href="https://dos.uccs.edu/student-conduct">Student Code of Conduct</url> is to maintain the general welfare of the university community. The university strives to make the campus community a place of study, work, and residence where people are treated, and treat one another, with respect and civility. This course covers material that could generate strong opinions or emotions. Consider the Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative Principles: Integrity, Trust, Accountability, Transparency, Fairness, Respect, Rule of Law, and Viability, when considering conduct during the course. Learn more at the <url href="https://business.uccs.edu/resources/ethics">Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative at UCCS website</url>.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-academic-integrity">
    <title>Academic Integrity and Plagiarism</title>

    <p>
        The College of Business follows and enforces the student conduct rules and policies that are set forth by the university and are listed in the <url href="https://bit.ly/3xsNAdK">Student Rights and Responsibilities</url> section of the Academic Catalog.
    </p>
    <p>
        Students caught engaging in academic dishonesty may receive a zero on the assignment in question, an "F" in the class, or be suspended from the College of Business and/or university. This includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism (copying others’ work as your own—in part or in total—without the proper citations) and/or the use of artificial intelligence to write or contribute to assignments without instructor approval.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-generative-AI">
    <title>Generative AI</title>

    <p>
        Given that anything generated by AI has been culled from the web and restated or recreated without attribution (and sometimes even with false attribution), that content could be considered as to have been plagiarized.
    </p>

        <ul>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-privacy">
    <title>Privacy Statement</title>

    <p>
        Assuring privacy among faculty and students engaged in online and face-to-face instructional activities helps promote open and robust conversations and mitigates concerns that comments made within the context of the class will be shared beyond the classroom. As such, recordings of instructional activities occurring in online or face-to-face classes may be used solely for internal class purposes by the faculty member and students registered for the course, and only during the period in which the course is offered. Students will be informed of such recordings by a statement in the syllabus for the course in which they will be recorded. Instructors who wish to make subsequent use of recordings that include student activity may do so only with informed written consent of the students involved or if all student activity is removed from the recording. Recordings including student activity that have been initiated by the instructor may be retained by the instructor only for individual use.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-responsible-reporting">
    <title>Responsible Reporting:  Institutional Equity/Title IX Statement</title>

    <p>
        The Office of Institutional Equity (OIE), administers the University of Colorado (CU) Sexual Misconduct policy (including Title IX), the UCCS Discrimination and Harassment Policy, and the CU Conflict of Interest in Cases of Amorous Relationships Policy. All UCCS faculty and staff, including student employees, are considered “responsible employees” and must report any suspected or known conduct that may be in violation of these policies (“prohibited conduct”) directly to the OIE. This reporting requirement exists to support the safety of our campus community, and there is no statute of limitations. Prohibited conduct includes unwanted verbal or physical conduct that is sexual in nature, or based on a protected class (such as, gender, race, veteran status, disability, etc.). You may review the Applicable Policies and OIE's Resolution Procedures <url href="https://equity.uccs.edu/">here</url>. While reporting prohibited conduct to the OIE is required by UCCS employees, participation in an OIE resolution process through the OIE is voluntary. Confidential reporting, and access to medical and mental health services, are available to students through the UCCS Wellness Center at 719-255-4444.

educational mission. UCCS expects every member of the university community to contribute to
an inclusive and respectful culture for all in its classrooms, work environments, and at campus
