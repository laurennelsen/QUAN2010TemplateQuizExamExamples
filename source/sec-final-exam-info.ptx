    <title>Final Exam Information</title>

  <p>
   The Final Exam will be available on Canvas to take during class on the day listed in the syllabus.  (You must be in person in the classroom to take the exam.)
  </p>


  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The exam will cover 8, 9, 13, 10, and 14-15 from the textbook, which are Chapters 9-13 in the course notes: <url href="https://laurennelsen.github.io/QUAN2010/QUAN_2010_Notes.html"> Link to course notes </url>
        
      </p>
      
    </li>

<!-- <li>
      <p>
        The exam will be broken into two parts, and you will have 60 minutes for each part of the exam.
      </p>
    </li>-->

<li>
  <p>
During the exam you may use your notes, the online course notes, the quiz/exam information site, a basic calculator (no phone) and a blank Excel file.  Some problems will require you to upload an Excel file with all your work/calculations in order to receive credit.
During quizzes you may NOT search the internet, use generative AI or use other resources that are not allowed.   </p>
</li>


<li>
  <p>
    You are NOT allowed to use other people's work or search internet sites while taking the test.  If you share you answers and others use them, both you and the students you shared with may receive a zero for the exam and may fail the course.
  </p>
</li>

<li>

  <p>
    Even though you are allowed to use your notes and course resources during the exam, I strongly recommend making a <q>cheat sheet</q> to use while you take the exam!  It can help you prepare for the exam and be ready for the types of questions that will be on the exam.  (If you don't prepare and practice the example problems, you might find yourself spending a long time searching and trying to figure out how to do problems while you're taking the exam.)
  </p>

  </li>


<li>
  <p>
    Unless otherwise indicated, you must show steps/include all of your Excel calculations and formulas that demonstrate the process you take to get to the final answer.
  </p>

  <p>
  For problems involving probability distributions (such as the binomial or normal distribution), you need to use the Excel files to find any relevant values and not use values from a table.
  </p>

  <p>
    For problems that require showing work, credit will be given for not only the final answer, but the work/justification/formulas that supports that answer.

  </p>
</li>


<li>
  <p>
    If you have a question during the exam, ask me!  It is much better to ask right away than to stay stuck for a long time.

    <title>Final Exam Format</title>


    

    <p>
      The exam may have some or all of the following problems/types of problems.  (The exam may have all of these types of problems or a subset of these types of problems.  Some of these problems might not have all the parts that were on corresponding quiz/homework problems.)  Examples of these problems (except for the multiple choice problems) are shown below under <xref ref="exercises-exam-1-practice"/>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Problems on the exam might not be the same format or the same submission type as the example problems under <xref ref="exercises-exam-1-practice"/>.  (For example, a problem requiring upload of an Excel file might be multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank, or vice versa.)
    </p>

    <p>
            <em>Note:  On the exam, the problems may not all be labeled with the corresponding quiz objective/homework problem.</em>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      For each problem involving a hypothesis test, you may be given a left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed test.  So even if the example test is a two-tailed test, you might be given a one-tailed test on the exam (or vice-versa).  So make sure you understand the process and are not just copying the formulas!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For the multiple choice problems, I recommend looking back at conceptual homework assignments, reviewing concepts from the notes/the book and making sure you understand the definitions and topics we've talked about.
    </p>

    
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <em>Multiple choice problems</em> from these chapters.  (No work is required to be shown for these.)
                </p>

      Look over all of your class notes and make sure you understand everything we have talked about.  Look back at these chapters/problems in the textbook.  Review the MyLab homework and the quiz problems.  (I do not guarantee that all exam questions will look exactly like one of those problems.)

  <p>
    A company wondered if people liked the user interface of their upgraded website.  They survey a random selection of their customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose that for <m>n=45</m> surveyed customers, 32 preferred the new user interface.
  </p>
  </introduction>

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find a <m>95\%</m> confidence interval for the proportion of all the company's customers that prefer the new interface.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>\alpha=1-0.95=0.05</m>, <m>\alpha/2=0.025</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\overline{p}=\frac{32}{45}\approx 0.7111</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>z_{\alpha/2}=NORM.S.INV(.025+.95)\approx 1.96</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Convidence interval formula:  <m>\overline{p}\pm (z_{\alpha/2})\cdot\left(\sqrt{\frac{\overline{p}(1-\overline{p})}{n}}\right)</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        The confidence interval is approximately:
        <me>.7111\pm (1.96)\left(\sqrt{\frac{.7111(1-.7111)}{45}}\right)\rightarrow \boxed{ (0.5787, 0.8435) }</me>
      </p>
    </answer>
  </task>

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose the company claims that at least <m>85\%</m> of all the company's customers prefer the new interface.  Does the confidence interval you found support this claim?  Explain why or why not.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        No, it does not.  We are <m>95\%</m> confident that <m>p</m> is between <m>57.87\%</m> and <m>84.35\%</m>, and <m>85\%</m> is larger than <m>84.35\%</m>.

    A company tests two different packagings for their product.  They ask members of a focus group to rate how appealing each packagin for the product is on a scale of 1-10.  A total of 25 focus group members were samples.  The file attached below is a summary of ratins for packaging A and ratings for packaging B.

  <p>
    Let <m>\alpha=0.01</m> and test the hypothesis that the average difference in rating between packaging A and B is not equal to 0 points.  (Assume <m>\mu_1</m> is the average rating for packaging A and <m>\mu_2</m> is the average rating for packaging B, and let <m>\mu_d=\mu_1-\mu_2</m>.)

    A CEO is curious if the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than <m>30\%</m>.  They conduct a survey of employees.  Suppose that for <m>n=380</m> surveyed employees, 125 were satisfied with their job.  Use <m>\alpha=0.05</m> and test the hypothesis that the proportion of all employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than <m>30\%</m>.

    </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <p>
      Since the p-value is bigger than <m>\alpha=0.05</m>, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.  So there is <em>not</em> enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is greater than <m>30\%</m>.

    <em>Week 10 HW Question 8:</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose a student has two possible routes for their commute to school.  Because they never want to be late for class, they want to choose the route that provides a more consistent commute time.  Being a hopeless statistician, the student meticulously drove the first route 20 times and the second route 25 times and calculated the standard deviations for each.  The following table summarizes sample data collected from two different routes.

      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        (Since Route B has the bigger sample standard deviation, Route B is <q>Population 1</q> and Route A is <q>Population 2</q>.)

    A researcher wants to study average commute time for students at UCCS and students at CU Denver.  Out of 35 students from CU Denver, the average commute time was <m>\overline{x}_1=34</m>, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=5.2</m> minutes.  Then out of 30 students from UCCS, the average commute time was <m>\overline{x}_2=22</m> minutes, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=8.3</m> minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Assume that the population variances are not equal and that <m>df=47</m>.
  </p>

    We want to test the hypothesis that the difference in the average commute times between CU Denver students and UCCS students is less than 15 minutes.

      Since the p-value (<m>0.0467</m>) is less than <m>alpha=0.05</m>, we reject the null hypothesis, and we have enough evidence to conclude that the difference in average commute times is less than 15 minutes.
