            <p>
              A business compares the amount it spends on advertising (thousands of dollars per month) to its revenues (thousands of dollars per month) over the last few months.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider the Excel file below that contains data that was collected comparing Advertising Expense measured in thousands of dollars/month and Revenue measured in thousands of dollars/month:

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Compute the sample correlation coefficient, <m>r</m>.  (Round to three decimal places.)
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Let <m>x=</m>Advertising Expense and <m>y=</m>Revenue.  Find the equation of the regression line.  (Round the slope and y-intercept to three decimal places.)
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    If the advertising expense is 5.1 thousand dollars per month, what is the predicted revenue, rounded to the nearest dollar?  (Use the formula you found in the previous part with the rounded slope and y-intercept to find this.)

            <p>
              Your class conducted a semester-long project analyzing sales data from a local bookstore. You collected data on 40 different books, including:
            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Sales (in dollars)
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Number of pages
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Average customer rating
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Shelf location score (a subjective score from 1-5 based on visibility and foot traffic)
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              You’ve been given a cleaned dataset below and asked to build a multiple linear regression model to predict Sales using the other three variables.  Let 
 <m>x_1</m> be the number of pages, <m> x_2</m> be the average customer rating, 
<m>x_3</m> be the shelf location score, and 
<m>y</m> be sales (in dollars).

                    Use the Data Analysis tool to run a multiple regression using this dataset.  What is the regression equation?  (Round each parameter to one decimal place when you type in the equation.)
