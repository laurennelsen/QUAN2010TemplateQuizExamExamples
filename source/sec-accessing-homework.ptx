  <title>Accessing MyLab Homework</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        To access the homework, go to the <q>VitalSource</q> tab on Canvas.  Here are instructions for how to do this:
    </p>
    <p>
        <url href="external/sheets/MyLabInstructions.pdf" />

    </p>
  </introduction>


  <p>
    After doing this, you should also be able to access individual assignments through the links in Canvas.  
    
    However, after the due date passes, you might still want to go back and look at previous assignments.  To do that, you will want to access MyLab <em>through the VitalSource tab</em> on Canvas instead of through the individual assignment links.  Then you should be able to go look at the MyLab <q>gradebook</q> and see previous assignments.
  </p>


  <p>
    The due dates for assignments in MyLab should match what is shown in the syllabus.  However, if you miss a due date, I still want you to do the homework and get a chance to practice what we're learning.

    So until <em>the Friday before finals week</em> assignments will allow you to continue working on them for full credit.  I encourage you to still try to complete assignments by the deadlines!  But I hope this is helpful if you do fall a little behind.

</p>

<p>
    To continue working on an assignment after the <q>due date</q>, choose the <q>improve my score</q> option.
